When compared with the previous type of web sites - business cards, the following analogy is obtained. There you handed a small business card and said goodbye in the hope that you will someday be remembered. Here you immediately give the most complete amount of information, almost a book, which has everything to solve the needs of the client. This is not just a business card, it is already a full-fledged office with all its advantages.

Just as a person is greeted by their appearance, a company is greeted by its website. As a rule, the client always, even if unconsciously, sees / feels seriousness in intentions (or lack of it). A corporate website is a great way to show a serious attitude to business.

Moreover, by creating a corporate type of site, you give the client what he needs. The client feels the respect shown to him when he sees how much necessary and useful information has been created and posted specially for him. Pleasant design, convenient management, reliable and regularly updated information - these are the characteristic features that distinguish a corporate website from business cards.

Well, okay, all of the above is somewhat subjective (although verified from personal experience), so let's add objectivity and highlight the specific pros and cons of a corporate website.`,

Each audience has its own needs, and it is the portal site that is able to satisfy them all.

Actually, it is on this that the success or failure of the portal is built. The main thing is to understand the needs of your target audience. If you know what your users need, then you can give it to them through the Internet portal.

Of course, there are situations when a company has some kind of unique offer or an individual approach to pricing for each person. But even in this case, everything can be automated!

Consumers find the product of interest by visiting the retailer's website directly or by searching among alternative suppliers. Trading can take place through a small local store, a large retailer, an e-commerce store, or an individual who sells goods through a third-party service. If you need to know what an online store is and how it works, in this article we will describe in detail its structure and tell you how to run a successful online business. The online store has a rather complex structure, which includes both the main menu and submenu elements. The main menu should display the most important information about product categories and promotions. One of the best ways to know which pages to include in the navigation bar and which to skip or use as part of a dropdown is to view user flow data in Google Analytics.`,
          additional_text: `

An example of a successfully created structure can be seen on the websites of many sports brands. Each site displays very simple navigation, despite the fact that the site offers a wide variety of products. This simplicity makes sense. When you want to shop for shorts, you wouldn't want to start with the shorts category because it will show products for both men and women. Instead, when you land on a global sports brand site, you can start by scrolling through the main category you need, and then the options get more and more specific. In this case, the main category is half-customer.

The structure of the online store is based on the "from simple to complex" model, where each category contains even more categories. The structure of a good service includes a convenient search by category, which should be displayed both on the main page and in subcategories.`,

          text: `Landing or landing page (landing page) is a one-page type of site for capturing the attention of the client for the subsequent performance of the targeted action. A minimum of all distractions: the landing page contains only key information that can interest and encourage you to make a purchase of a product or order services.

Other names for a landing page are a landing page, a capture page.

What is the correct landing?

First, it is a simple and user-friendly design. Due to its lightness, the landing page loads quickly and does not cause unnecessary questions.

Secondly, the landing page contains key information about why the client should make a purchase or take another targeted action (for example, subscribe to a newsletter). Benefits, time-limited promotions, high-quality photos, calls to action are the main points that make up a landing page.

Now there is a real flowering of landings. And there are reasons for this. The main advantage of this type of sites is increased conversion due to narrow focus (a specific product / service for a specific audience). Nothing superfluous - that's the secret to the success of the capture page.

Unlike a huge storefront of an online store, a landing page visitor sees only one thing. When we do not have a wide choice, then often we are even glad of this - there is no need to waste time and energy on comparison and choice.

The disadvantage of landing is just its advantage in the form of a narrow focus. It's like a double-edged sword. If you have a second (third, tenth, thousandth) product / service, then there are two ways out. The first one is once again to make a new landing page for it. The second is to create an online store with a wide range of products.

Some owners of online stores use landing pages at the same time. And this is quite justified. For example, they have a very popular product on sale. It sells well in the store, but if you additionally organize a landing page specifically for this product, then sales will go even better. This tactic of simultaneously attacking on all fronts is becoming more common in online commerce. Why not? After all, it is effective and does not require special costs.`,
