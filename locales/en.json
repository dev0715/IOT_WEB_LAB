According to statistics published in Datareportal, 67% of adults worldwide use smartphones daily, which is almost 5.19 billion people (out of a total population of 7.75 billion). The trend towards the transition from simple mobile devices to feature-rich smartphones is only increasing every year. It is assumed that in the near future a person will be directly connected with his smartphone, that is, all functions and all information from our gadgets will directly enter our brain. And while many inventors are working on it, people are wasting their time on seemingly useless apps like a low-frequency mosquito repeller, a watermelon ripeness indicator, a bubble wrap simulator, or an app that visually transforms a smartphone screen into a glass of beer. In short, the relevance of mobile application development is growing not only every year, but also every month. Hundreds of new mobile apps are released online every day. It would seem difficult to come up with something new, but good developments in collaboration with good marketing can bring a lot of money to the creator, a clear confirmation of this is the recently sensational TikTok, whose ratings continue to grow at lightning speed."
